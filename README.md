# BlackFatherhood
This website is focused on my experience of being a Black Father. As I can only speak from my own experiences, raising girls. I have also linked blog post from my official website. 

The website contains a photo gallery of Black Art and also two links to blog post that I have written on my personal website which is www.darrin-johnson.com (wix site)

I hope you enjoy!!

Thank you!!
